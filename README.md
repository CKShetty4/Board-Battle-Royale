# Board-Battle-Royale

Welcome to **Board Battle Royale**, a series of multiplayer online and offline classic board games with a modern twist! This project offers customizable themes, social features, and a leaderboard for a competitive edge. Dive into timeless board games, challenge friends or past opponents, and experience each game in your unique style. The first game developed under this series is **Tic Tac Toe**.

## üé≤ Project Overview

**Board Battle Royale** brings together various board games in one application, where each game is stored in its own folder for easy expansion. The first game, **Tic Tac Toe**, is live and can be found in the `tic-tac-toe` folder, with more games to be added soon.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiplayer Modes**: Play online or offline with friends or challenge a past opponent.
- **Game Variety**: Multiple games, with Tic Tac Toe as the first in the series. New games will be added in their own folders.
- **Customization**: Choose from various themes to personalize your gaming experience.
- **Leaderboard and Social Features**: Track your rank and achievements, and challenge other players.

### Current Game: Tic Tac Toe

- **Two Modes**: 
  - *Player vs Player*: Engage in classic gameplay against a friend.
  - *Player vs CPU*: Face off against a CPU opponent with a custom-built algorithm that adds a touch of unpredictability, simulating a human opponent.
- **Symbol Selection**: Player One can select their symbol, X or O, before the game begins (X always starts).
- **Score Display**: Tracks wins for each player and the total number of ties.
- **Responsive and Engaging UI**: Built with a focus on accessibility and smooth user experience across devices.

## üìÇ Project Structure

Each game under **Board Battle Royale** is developed as an independent module and stored in its own folder. For example:
- `tic-tac-toe/`: Folder for Tic Tac Toe game
- `future-game/`: Placeholder for future games

Each game folder contains its own README, making it easy to navigate and set up each game individually.
